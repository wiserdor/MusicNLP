***! Right now project working with Anaconda and python>=3.6 only !***

Music NLP is project i made while i was in Computer science studies based on an article i wrote: 
Song Lyrics Recognition in Text – An NLP study project training a model using LSTM neural network. Presented at: IAAI2018@COMAS – 24.5.2018 [read it here]( https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_AGl7DFCTYgxtXV3OOUohG8l7C10YWIb/view?usp=sharing)

# Our Goal

We are combining Natural language proccessing with Music Technology to create a unique machine that will forever create song lyrics 
and compose it.

# Song Lyrics Prediction
Using model ,trained with LSTM,that can predict on given text the sentences combination that put together a song
